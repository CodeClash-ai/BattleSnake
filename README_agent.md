# Notes for teammate agents

## Round 1 (this round) — done by opus-4-7

### Situation at start
- Round 0 (previous round): tie between opus-4-7 and pambrose__pambrose-kotlin.
- We had the SimpleSnake reference bot (no collision avoidance!), so did the opponent, so we just tied.
- Average game length was ~4.5 turns because both snakes suicide constantly.

### Change I made
- Replaced `main.py` with a safety-first heuristic snake:
    - Enumerates 4 candidate moves, filters out illegal (walls, snake bodies).
    - Considers other snakes' tails movable (they'll vacate next turn) UNLESS they just ate (body[-1] == body[-2]).
    - Avoids head-to-head losses vs equal/longer opponents; prefers head-to-head kills vs shorter opponents.
    - Uses flood-fill from each candidate cell (excluding new head) to make sure we don't trap ourselves. Prefers space >= our length.
    - Scores remaining candidates by: reachable space (weight 2×), distance to nearest food via BFS (weighted higher when health low or when we're shorter), head-to-head kill bonus, mild center-tropism, wall/edge penalty.
- No pathfinding search deeper than 1 ply, but flood-fill gives good coarse trapping avoidance.

### Testing
Ran 50 local games against SimpleSnake baseline (in `/tmp/opp/`) with the local `game/battlesnake` CLI: **50W/0L/0D**. Solo game survives >80 turns.

### Files
- `main.py` — the bot (heuristic-based, no external deps beyond flask which is only used by `server.py`).
- `server.py` — Flask HTTP server (unchanged).

### How to test locally
```bash
# Start our bot
cd /workspace && PORT=8001 python3 main.py &
# Start baseline opponent
cp -r /workspace /tmp/opp   # then replace main.py with SimpleSnake
cd /tmp/opp && PORT=8002 python3 main.py &
# Play
/workspace/game/battlesnake play -W 11 -H 11 \
    --name me  --url http://localhost:8001 \
    --name opp --url http://localhost:8002 \
    -g standard
```

## Ideas for future rounds

1. **2-ply / minimax search**: currently we only look 1 move ahead. A shallow minimax over both snakes' next moves (16 leaves per ply) with a tight time budget would help against smarter opponents.
2. **Better trap detection**: flood-fill currently ignores dynamic tail motion during the fill. Doing a BFS that "advances" over turns and knows tails will vacate would give more accurate escape estimates. Look at "voronoi/territory" style scoring: split reachable squares by who reaches them first.
3. **Aggressive shortcutting**: when we're clearly longer than the opponent, drive toward their head to force head-to-head kills.
4. **Food timing**: right now food weight scales with health only; better to compute "can I reach food in health/2 turns and still have escape space".
5. **Opponent modeling**: if the opponent is still SimpleSnake, we can predict their move exactly (`_move_to` toward farthest food), and set traps.

## Analysis scripts (not written yet, feel free to add)

- Suggested: parse `/logs/rounds/*/sim_*.jsonl` and gather win/loss stats vs opponent per turn count, food events, etc. See snippet at top of round 1 shell history:
```python
import json, glob
for f in glob.glob('/logs/rounds/0/sim_*.jsonl'):
    lines = open(f).read().splitlines()
    last = json.loads(lines[-1])
    # 'winnerName', 'isDraw' fields available.
```
